Version 1.7  3/14/01

! added IProtExternal.  Enter any command and it will be invoked when a hack
  attempt is detected (during the initial auth attempt phase). use %s for IP
! removed IProtIgnore and replaced it with IProtIgnoreUser and IProtIgnoreIP
o added IProtIgnoreUser=  One or more strings or regex patterns
o added IProtIgnoreIP= One or more strings or regex patters
o fixed a couple bugs
  - IProtNag was not false by default
  - Email still sometimes went to AdminEmail instead of IProtEmail

Version 1.6  3/18/00

* added IProtEmail for more generic email notification
* added IProtEnable to toggle module on/off in different virtual hosts
* added IProtNag flag to toggle email on/off for repeat attempts (first attempt   always causes an email to be sent)
  
Version 1.5  11/9/99
* Split out Auth/Access Timeout variables.  Now you need to set 2 variables.
  IProtAuthTimeout is in seconds, and is the timeout for password hacks.
  IProtAccessTimeout is in hours, and is the timeout for shared/stolen passes.
* Added new IProtNag variable.  By default this is "Off".  Email notification
  will now only be sent ONCE for each uniquely detected IP address or username.
  If it is set to "On" then email will be sent every time a hack or stolen 
  password is detected (this is the pre-1.5 behavior). 

Version 1.4  10/13/99

* Changed algorithm used for detecting password "hack" attempts, based on
  user feedback.  (Checks passwords instead of usernames...)
* When sending mail, notify whether it's a hack attempt or a stolen password.
* Changed error level if dbopen fails to just a warning. This happens 
  sometimes under heavy load because of locking contention on the db file.  

Version 1.3  9/20/99

* Added protection against password "hack" attempts.
* Misc bugfixes for improved db compatibility.

Version 1.2  7/7/99 
* Removed dependency on GDBM
* Cleaned up some stray debug print statements.

Version 1.1  3/8/99

* Added optional parameter IProtIgnore
* Added server hostname to notification email
