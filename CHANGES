Version 1.9.0 02/25/03
* Defaults provided for all values, directives left out of httpd.conf
  can no longer cause the server to segfault.
* IProtAbuseEmail, IProtHackEmail, and IProtBWEmail have been added for
  greater control of notification email.
* Added support to eliminate proxy based hack attacks.
* Addition of an admin interface for some of the iprot configs and to
  add/edit/delete blocks
* New make system that works through apache's configure/build system.
* Ability to drop all HEAD requests.
* Choice of return results...403, redirect, or drop connection.
* Optional internal redirection to a user supplied page on blocks,
  ErrorDocument 403 not needed anymore.
* The timestamp of accesses for a username is now updated with every
  successfully authenticated access to support the failed authentication
  feature. Previously it was not updated.
* Server_rec->server_hostname has been replaced with
  ap_get_server_name() which takes into account the status of the
  UseCanonicalName configuration directive. This is the recommended way
  to get the server hostname.
* Full memory management and cleanup routines have been incorporated to
  overcome some of the pitfalls of older apache memory management that
  has caused the iprot dbm files to corrupt.
* Bugs which could cause iProtect to seg fault on servers with heavy
  loads have been fixed.

Version 1.8.1 8/24/01
* Split Notify directive into NotifyIP and NotifyUser so user
  can turn off email for either hack attempts or abuse or both.

Version 1.8  7/10/01
* fixed segmentation faulting on newer versions of FreeBSD with Berkley DB

Version 1.7  3/14/01

! added IProtExternal.  Enter any command and it will be invoked when a hack
  attempt is detected (during the initial auth attempt phase). use %s for IP
! removed IProtIgnore and replaced it with IProtIgnoreUser and IProtIgnoreIP
o added IProtIgnoreUser=  One or more strings or regex patterns
o added IProtIgnoreIP= One or more strings or regex patters
o fixed a couple bugs
  - IProtNag was not false by default
  - Email still sometimes went to AdminEmail instead of IProtEmail

Version 1.6  3/18/00

* added IProtEmail for more generic email notification
* added IProtEnable to toggle module on/off in different virtual hosts
* added IProtNag flag to toggle email on/off for repeat attempts (first attempt   always causes an email to be sent)
  
Version 1.5  11/9/99
* Split out Auth/Access Timeout variables.  Now you need to set 2 variables.
  IProtAuthTimeout is in seconds, and is the timeout for password hacks.
  IProtAccessTimeout is in hours, and is the timeout for shared/stolen passes.
* Added new IProtNag variable.  By default this is "Off".  Email notification
  will now only be sent ONCE for each uniquely detected IP address or username.
  If it is set to "On" then email will be sent every time a hack or stolen 
  password is detected (this is the pre-1.5 behavior). 

Version 1.4  10/13/99

* Changed algorithm used for detecting password "hack" attempts, based on
  user feedback.  (Checks passwords instead of usernames...)
* When sending mail, notify whether it's a hack attempt or a stolen password.
* Changed error level if dbopen fails to just a warning. This happens 
  sometimes under heavy load because of locking contention on the db file.  

Version 1.3  9/20/99

* Added protection against password "hack" attempts.
* Misc bugfixes for improved db compatibility.

Version 1.2  7/7/99 
* Removed dependency on GDBM
* Cleaned up some stray debug print statements.

Version 1.1  3/8/99

* Added optional parameter IProtIgnore
* Added server hostname to notification email
